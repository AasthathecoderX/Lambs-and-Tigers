Description: There are two players, the Lamb Player and the Tiger Player. At the start of the game,
the Tiger Player places down 3 Tigers on the field. Then, the Lamb Player and the Tiger Player begin
the real match. For the next 14 turns, the Lamb Player starts and puts down a lamb on any open tile.
The tiger player then takes over and moves one of the tiger pieces. If there is a lamb in an adjacent
tile and the tile behind it is empty, then the Tiger can choose to "Jump" over the lamb itself and
"Kill" it. Once 14 turns pass, the Lamb Player must move one of the Lambs to an adjacent tile every turn.
The game ends when the Lamb Player has a total of less than 4 Lambs (Tigers Win) OR if the Tigers have 
no place to move (Lambs Win).

Comments: It might look a little ugly but the game itself works fine.

Reflection: In total, this game took about 16 hours to make. Building the circle objects, map design,
turn system were of moderate difficulty. Creating the Adjacent and Jumping Tile system was of severe difficulty.
But most of all, the win condition was the most difficult part about this whole game, because it took around 4
hours to complete due to how tigers can move. However, in the end, everything worked out and the game works completely
fine.
